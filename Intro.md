Modern Internet is one of two things - a web site or web service. Web Services are APIs that facilitate information exchange using well structured message formats such as JSON, XML etc.  APIs are the essential part of the new IT infrastructure that makes e-commerce, finance, services possible. IT engineering teams or operations teams have the inherent need to know the status and health of their APIs and sites. 
 
ProAutoma provides easy to use tools to monitor web sites and APIs.  Our simple to use webapp helps user to configure and explore APIs quickly.  Configured monitors run at chosen frequency in global infrastructure and data centers across many countries such as Frankfurt, Singapore, N. Virginia. 
 
A monitor can be setup with a set of test criteria. When a test fails, notifications are sent out to your favorite channel.  Out of box, Email, Slack, Discord and Web Hooks are supported.
